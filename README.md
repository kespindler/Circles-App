# Circles

This was one of my first iPhone apps that I built. It's really basic, it needs 
some optimization (it starts getting really slow eventually), but it's kind of 
cool. Inspired by [Koalas to the Max](http://www.koalastothemax.com/).

Feel free to ask me about any of the code. It's really basic, but there are 
definitely a few interesting nuances.

# Attributions, Licensing, and More

I'm use the reload icon from [Iconic](http://somerandomdude.com/work/iconic/). 
I'm using some random Circles art for the background that I found on Google 
search. If it's yours, I'm happy to attribute it or stop using it. I'm using 
Magritte's Son of Man as the default image. All other work is mine. Don't use
it without my written permission, but feel free to learn from it.
